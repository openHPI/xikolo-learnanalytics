## Decisions / Choices I made
This text should provide background information on the changes you did. A great merge request answers at least the following question:
- Which architectural or implementation decisions did you make? And why?

Remember: The more information you give other developers, the easier it is for them to understand and review the code, and the more helpful their review will ultimately be.

For more context, you should also link to related merge requests as well as corresponding issues on the bug tracker.
